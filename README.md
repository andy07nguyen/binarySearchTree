# binarySearchTree

Lots of methods! Play with them! Let me know if you make them better!
Keep in mind that the rebalance method will only work in four different situations. It's just meant to get you started thinking about the problem.
Challenge:
modify the insert method so that the tree doesn't get unbalanced.
